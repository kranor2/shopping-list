# Shopping List

## Description

I built this project as an adjacent activity to the DOM Manipulation lesson from the Odin Project. The prompt for this activity comes from the MDN Web Docs exercises for DOM manipulation. As one of many hands-on exercises for JavaScript DOM manipulation, this project is my response to the prompt wherein students are challenged to flesh out code based on planning or pseudocode instructions for a basic web application enabling the user to build and edit a shopping list. This project has helped me to further develop and feel confident in my basic JavaScript skills, especially creating, retrieving, and modifying DOM elements, and has provided me a prompt which I may elaborate on further in the future.

I built this project as part of the Foundations course with the Odin Project. As the conclusion of a unit on flexbox layouts, this project is my response to the prompt wherein students are challenged to replicate a webpage (the context being a template for a landing page) as displayed in an image (attached to the prompt) using HTML and CSS. This project has helped me to further develop and feel confident in my HTML and CSS skills, especially flexbox, and provides me a hands-on introduction to how I might operate as a developer working off of a hi-fi prototype from a UX designer.
